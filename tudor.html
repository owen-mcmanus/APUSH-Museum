        <h4 style="margin: 0 0 10px 0" class="exibit-title">Selling Ice</h4>
        <p>
          Tudor chose to ship his ice to the carribean, in hopes of selling ice
          to the masses. However, this turned out to be harder than he imagined.
          Although the people did enjoy the ice, the people in the caribean also
          had no experience in ice, thus they didn’t have any way of keeping it
          from melting. Without ice houses, all of Tudor’s profits quickly went
          down the drain.
        </p>
        <h4 style="margin: 30px 0 10px 0" class="exibit-title">Failure</h4>
        <p>
          After his failed attempt in the carribean, Tudor tried to sell his ice
          in Cuba, in which he lost even more money. He kept shipping ice, and
          kept learning new ways to save both ice and money. After spending
          parts of 1812 and 1813 in debitors prision due to being swindled by a
          buisness partner .Even after jail, Tudor was unabashed, he borrowed
          money to buy even more ice from massachusetts and critically, an
          icehouse in cuba. With this icehouse, Tudor was finally able to sell
          ice at a profit.

        <p>
          Soon, Frederic was expanding his buiness to Charleston, Savannah and
          New Orleans while also developing some new sales tactics. One strategy
          was to teach bartenders how to store and use ice in their cocktails,
          developing demand for his ice. Another was to teach coffee makers to
          use his ice in creating ice cream, creating for even higher demand.
          However, this total demand was soon outpacing his abiltiy to harvest
          ice. But a hotel owner named Nathaniel Wyeth came up with an invention
          that allowed horses to replace the lengthy hand cutting process that
          ice usually took. With a massive increase in his ice production, Tudor
          soon was selling ice from Hong Kong, to India, to the UK all while
          making a tidy profit. From his massive ice trade empire, he earned the
          nickname, “The Ice King”

          The End of An Era
        </h4>
        <p>
          In 1864, Tudor’s death signaled a change in the american ice buisness,
          though his ice empire had stretched around the world and he is said to
          have amassed 11 million dollars (around 200 million today) it was not
          invincible to the progress of techology. In 1854 the advent of the
          commerical ice maker reduced the need for shipping american ice around
          the world. Yet this new technology created a new era, one of ice
          tongs, ice boxes. and refirdgeration.
