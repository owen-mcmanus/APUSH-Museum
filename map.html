        The exhibit begins with models of ancient ice storage methods. The room
        is themed as a remote wilderness which is designed to show the
        difficulty of storing ice. This section flows into ice in early America.
        This room shows the visitor that ice is only available to the colonial
        elite. It contains the facade of a colonial plantation house, showing an
        example of an ice house and ice box. Across the room lies two smaller
        exhibits for Cullens’s and Perkins’s attempts at artificial
        refrigeration. An opening in the wall leads to a discussion on Tudor’s
        ice empire. His ship, the Tuscany, is central to the museum. In this
        room, the visitor can enter the ship to learn how ice was stored and to
        see a variety of insulation materials. Juxtaposed across the room is Dr.
        Gorrie’s office. This section describes the developments in artificial
        ice and Gorrie’s feud with Tudor. In one corner, is an ice lake where
        viewers can participate in simulations of the ice harvesting process. In
        the opposite corner, is a Swift reefer car. This helps to explain why
        ice was in demand and why Tudor was able to make his millions. Finally,
        the visitor learns about the rise of refrigeration. Three smaller
        displays explain developments in insulation, air conditioning, and
        refrigeration. They showcase how ice became available to the masses. In
        the middle, lies an ice delivery cart to remind the viewer that natural
        ice was still cheap and effective. The exhibit finishes with replica
        kitchens from 1900 and the 1920s. These show how the domestic
        refrigerator made ice accessible in the home. The 1920s kitchen should
        strike the visitor as similar to today’s technology. As the visitor
        exits, they pass statistics showing just how common ice has become.
