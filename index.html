      <h2>The Ice Museum</h2>

        <p>
          From the egyptians to the romans, to wealthy italian merchants and
          british monarchies, ice has long been enjoyed by the elite as a
          expensive luxury food. Though we in modern times may have the luxury
          of ice on demand, for a majority of history, ice has remained
          unobtainable to most people. In 400 BC, persian engineers had created
          means for storing ice in the middle of the desert. By creating large
          underground spaces that we naturally cooled called yakhchal, the
          persians were able to store large amounts of ice from nearby
          mountains. These technological advances allowed for the persian
          royalty to enjoy chilled treats in the hot summer months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet by the 19th century, almost every family had a refrigerator
          powered by ice. So how is it that what once was reserved for the most
          wealthy became a common house hold commodity? Due to the enterprising
          efforts of one young man, ice shipped from the US soon was being sold
          around the world, refreshing drinks from Hong Kong to Brazil.
          Revolutionizing how food was stored around the world. The
          comodification of ice demonstrates the transition of goods from a
          luxury to a staple.

              In 400 BC, anchient Persian archetects built Yakhchāls, large
              desert ice houses that stored mountain ice for the royal family.
              These icehouses had windtraps to help cool the icehouses even on
              the hottest of desert days.

              In 1806 Fredrick Tudor expanded the world ice to the common man by
              creating a company to ship and sell American Ice all over the
              world. Though his venture was not immediately sucessful, he
              eventually became rich and famous off of this buisness.
