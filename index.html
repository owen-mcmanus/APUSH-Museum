      <h2>The Ice Museum</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          From the Egyptians to the Romans, to wealthy Italian merchants and
          British monarchies, ice has long been enjoyed by the elite as an
          expensive luxury food. Though in modern times, we have the luxury of
          ice on demand, for a majority of history, ice remained unobtainable to
          most of the human population. In 400 BC, Persian engineers had created
          means for storing ice in the middle of the desert. By creating large
          underground spaces that we naturally cooled called yakhchal, the
          Persians were able to store large amounts of ice from nearby
          mountains. These technological advances allowed the Persian royalty to
          enjoy chilled treats during the hot summer months. In the 3rd century
          AD, Romans stored and sold ice from straw-covered ice pits, allowing
          for ice to be sold in special ice shops. But, whether in yakhchal or
          in ice pit, ice was always regarded as a luxury only obtainable by the
          rich. Unless one lived in an area where ice literally fell from the
          sky, ice was mostly unobtainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet by the 19th century, almost every family had a refrigerator
          powered by ice. This was invaluable as keeping food cool is one of the
          easiest ways to preserve food. During this era, ice became one of the
          most valuable commodities as both companies and individuals wanted to
          use ice for preservation. So how is it that what once was reserved for
          the most wealthy became a common household commodity? Due to the
          enterprising efforts of one young man, ice shipped from the US soon
          was being sold around the world, refreshing drinks from Hong Kong to
          Brazil. Revolutionizing how food was stored around the world. The
          commodification of ice demonstrates the transition of goods from a
          luxury to a staple.

                The Romans built large ice pits in the Alps. These pits would be

                would allow the air at the bottom to remain at the freezing
                point well into summer. The Romans were known to refrigerate
                cheese, wine, and oysters.

                Icehouses were designed to keep ice cool during hot summer
                months before refrigeration. While some ice houses were nothing
                more than dirt mounds, others were large, subterranean,
                brick-lined cylinders (like the one at Monticello shown here).
                Later, straw was used in addition to stone, providing
                insulation. Ice houses frequently had large upper openings
                allowing ice to be packed tightly, reducing melting. Despite
                this innovation, ice houses were still a luxury reserved only
                for plantation and estate owners. The yeoman farmer still relied
                on smoking, drying, and salting to preserve food.

                William Cullen, a professor at Glasgow University, gave the
                first public demonstration of artificial refrigeration. He
                pulled a vacuum in a flask of diethyl ether, causing the
                substance to boil and absorbing heat from the surroundings in
                the process. While unclear what temperature the flask reached,
                it is possible that he created the first artificial ice. This
                invention was ahead of its time and thus no one would put
                artificial refrigeration to good use until the works of later
                American inventors. Cullen would write two publications on
                refrigeration before pivoting to work in medicine. He would
                become one of Scotland's leading doctors developing the term
                neurosis and first applying the placebo effect to medical
                situations.

                Despite innovation in artificial refrigeration, nature was still
                the preferred way to keep items cool. Thomas Moore invented the
                icebox by placing a tin box inside a wood shell covered with
                rabbit fur and cloth. The gap between the layers would be filled
                with ice. He received a patent in 1802. While initially designed
                for Moore to transport butter in Maryland, he soon marketed it
                for other uses. To help with this, Moore invited Thomas
                Jefferson to test the new refrigerator. Jefferson was impressed.
                Their meeting sparked a relationship that would get Moore
                appointed as a commissioner, overseeing the construction of the
                Cumberland Road, even though he had no credentials.<br /><br />The
                image depicts an invitation from Moor to Jefferson. Jefferson's
                sketch of the ice box is in the bottom left.

                Jacob Perkins dabbled in everything from minting money and nail
                manufacturing to guns and ship instrumentation. Most
                importantly, he received the patent for "Apparatus and means for
                producing ice, and in cooling fluids." While in Philadelphia, he
                worked with Oliver Evans developing a high-pressure steam
                engine. This experience with pressurized fluids gave Evans the
                idea for a refrigerator. Perkins built a vapor-compression
                refrigerator and thus received the patent in 1835.

                On Tudor’s first ice selling venture, many doubted the
                feasibility of selling ice to the Caribbean. Surely the ice
                would just melt before it got through the month-long trip. The
                Boston Gazette reported, “No JOKE…A vessel has cleared at the
                Custom House for Martinique with a cargo of ice. We hope this
                will not prove a slippery speculation.” The reality of Tudor's
                first expedition was that a majority of the ice was lost in
                transit, while the rest simply melted in the Caribbean as there
                was no way to store the ice until it was sold.

                Though Tudor’s attempts at selling ice did not initially
                succeed, he persevered. By slowly making improvements to his ice
                transport business, such as using sawdust as an insulator and
                buying and building icehouses in the Caribbean, Tudor was slowly
                able to put his company in the green.

                In 1833, Tudor devised a bold new way to sell his ice, he would
                ship it to India. In India his ice was a smash hit,
                particularly, the British colonial overseers enjoyed the Ice.
                The delivery of ice to India would become one of Tudor’s most
                significant sources of revenue. <br /><br />

                Tudor was not without his competitors, most famously Dr. John
                Gorrie. Dr. Gorrie developed and patented the first mechanical
                refrigerator. It was initially used to chill the air of his
                office to help patients with yellow fever because observed that
                when fall came and the temperature cooled, yellow fever wouldn’t
                spread. Little did he know, the disease was actually carried by
                mosquitoes. His hand-powered machine expanded the air to cool
                its surroundings. He received a patent in 1851 for both his ice
                machine and air conditioner. Tudor was not pleased with his new
                competition and ran a smear campaign which led to negative press
                causing Gorrie to run out of funding just before his death in
                1855.

                The first refrigerated train car was invented by William Davis
                in 1867. It was designed to allow the transport of fish and
                strawberries from the Detroit area. Later, the beef industry
                became interested in the idea. Davis sold the patent to George
                H. Hammond. Hammond created a meatpacking business centered
                around the use of the refrigerated car. Later in 1878, Gustivis
                Swift redesigned the car. His Chicago-based meatpacking company
                used blocks of ice in the ceiling to cool the meet. This
                disrupted the railroad industry as they had invested in cars
                designed to carry live cattle. Swift’s company would grow to
                have 7,000 refrigerated cars and span the country.

                James Dewar invents the vacuum-insulated, silver-plated glass
                Dewar flask - a type of early thermos flask. - James Dewar was a
                Scottish scientist who was interested in being the first to
                condense and freeze hydrogen and helium. In order to do this,
                Dewar needed a well-insulated space. He built a container with a
                gap in the wall such that the air could be pulled out creating a
                vacuum. However, his vacuum wasn't strong enough. Thus to remove
                the remaining air he placed charcoal at the bottom. Charcoal, at
                low temperatures, will absorb gas and because of this Dewar was
                able to create a near-perfect vacuum. Dewar was the first to
                freeze hydrogen and got within 13 degrees of absolute zero. In
                the proses he invented the thermos, providing a valuable new
                tool to keep ice cold.

                Willis Carrier, a Pittsburgh inventor, discovered that air could
                be humidified by passing through water. This simple discovery
                would allow for the invention of air conditioning.
                Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographic and Publishing Company’s prints
                were being damaged by the summer heat and humidity. Carrier
                reversed his humidifier by blowing air over water-cooled coils.
                This both dehumidified the air and chilled it. Carrier continued
                to refine his design. Its appeal expanded beyond manufacturing.
                Cinemas and nickelodeons began to advertise cool air. Household

                existing icebox. It was inexpensive and required little power.
                The DOMELRE had automatic temperature control and worked like a

                Even with impressive innovation in refrigeration technology, the
                simple ice box was incredibly popular in the 1930s. There was
                tremendous demand for blocks of ice as it had to be delivered
                daily to almost every household. To meet this demand, the iceman
                and the ice wagon became a common occurrence. Every morning, a
                fresh delivery of Ice would be brought to your doorstep. One of
                the more interesting innovations of the time was the use of an
                ice card that helped icemen to know how much ice to deliver. By
                spinning the card and sticking it on the window, families were
                able to indicate how much ice they wanted.

                Early consumer refrigerators used toxic gasses such as ammonia,
                methyl chloride, or sulfur dioxide for coolant. This caused
                problems when the gasses leaked into the home. In 1927, Albert
                Einstein filed a patent for a refrigerator with no moving parts,
                reducing the chance of a leak. His ammonia, butane, and
                water-based system used electromagnetic fields to move mercury,
                changing the pressure and acting as a pump. His invention never
                caught on as in 1930, freon was invented. This provided a safe
                (for humans, not ozone) and cheap coolant for traditional
                refrigerators.

                One of the first popular electric refrigerators, the General
                Electric Monitor Top refrigerator signaled the end of the
                Icebox. As electric refrigerators became cheaper and more
                reliable, many switched to the new innovation. This marks the
                final transition away from ice. Electric refrigeration exploded
                in popularity throughout the 1950s with 80% of households owning
                a refrigerator by 1955. By 2005, 99.5% of households had a
                refrigerator. Cold, what was once reserved for the ruling elite,
                had finally become accessible to the masses.
