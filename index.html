      <h2>The Ice Museum</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          From the egyptians to the romans, to wealthy italian merchants and
          british monarchies, ice has long been enjoyed by the elite as a
          expensive luxury food. Though we in modern times may have the luxury
          of ice on demand, for a majority of history, ice has remained
          unobtainable to most people. In 400 BC, persian engineers had created
          means for storing ice in the middle of the desert. By creating large
          underground spaces that we naturally cooled called yakhchal, the
          persians were able to store large amounts of ice from nearby
          mountains. These technological advances allowed for the persian
          royalty to enjoy chilled treats in the hot summer months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet by the 19th century, almost every family had a refrigerator
          powered by ice. So how is it that what once was reserved for the most
          wealthy became a common house hold commodity? Due to the enterprising
          efforts of one young man, ice shipped from the US soon was being sold
          around the world, refreshing drinks from Hong Kong to Brazil.
          Revolutionizing how food was stored around the world. The
          comodification of ice demonstrates the transition of goods from a
          luxury to a staple.

              The Romans built large ice pits in the Alps. These pits would be
              filled with alternating layers of snow and straw. These layers
              would allow the air at the bottom to remain at the freezing point
              well into summer. The Romans were known to refrigerate cheese,
              wine, and oysters.

              Icehouses were designed to keep ice cool during hot summer months
              before refrigeration. While some ice houses were nothing more than
              dirt mounds, others were large, subterainian, brick-lined
              cylinders, like the one at Montecillo (shown here). Later, straw
              was used in addition to stone to provide insulation. Their large
              openings allowed ice to be packed tightly, reducing melting.
              Despite this innovation, ice houses were still a luxury reserved
              only for plantation and estate owners. Most still relied on
              smoking, drying, and salting to preserve food.

              Tudor was not without his competitors, most famously Dr. John
              Gorrie. Dr. Gorrie developed and patented the first mechanical
              refrigerator. It was initially used to chill the air of his office
              to help patients with yellow fever. He observed that when fall
              came and the temperature cooled, yellow fever wouldn’t spread.
              Little did he know, the disease was actually carried by
              mosquitoes. His hand-powered machine expanded air to cool his
              surroundings. He developed both an ice machine and an air
              conditioner. He received a patent in 1851. Tudor was not pleased
              at his new competition and ran a smear campaign which led to
              negative press causing Gorrie to run out of funding and die in
              1855.

              The first refrigerated train car was invented by William Davis in
              1867. It was designed to allow the transport of fish and
              strawberries from the Detroit area. Later, the beef industry
              became interested in the idea. Davis sold the patent to George H.
              Hammond. Hammond created a meat packing business centerered around
              use of the refrigerated car. Later in 1878, Gustivis Swift
              redesigned the car. His Chicago based meetpacking company used
              blocks of ice in the ceiling to cool the meet. This disrupted the
              railroad industry has they had invested in cars designed to carry
              live cattle. Swift’s company would grow to have 7,000 refrigerated
              cars and spaned the country.

              In 1912 Fred W Worlf Jr. created the DOMELRE (domestic electric
              refrigerator). This refrigerator would be placed on top of an
              existing ice box. It was inexpeancive and required little power.
              The DOMELRE had automatic temperature control and worked like a
              modern day refrigerator by using tubes of built in coolant instead
              of connecting to an outside water source. It sold until 1922.

              Early consumer refrigerators used toxic gases such as ammonia,
              methyl chloride, or sulphur dioxide for coolant. This caused
              problems when the gasses leaked into the home. In 1927, Albert
              Einstein filed a patent for a refrigerator with no moving parts,
              reducing the chance of a leak. His ammonia, butane, and water
              pased system used elecromatignetic fields to move murcury,
              changing the pressure and acting as a pump. His invention never
              caught on as in 1930, freon was invented. This provided a safe
              (for humans, not ozone) and cheep coolant for traditional
              refrigerators.
