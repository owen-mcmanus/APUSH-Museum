      <h2>The Ice Museum</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          From the egyptians to the romans, to wealthy italian merchants and
          british monarchies, ice has long been enjoyed by the elite as a
          expensive luxury food. Though we in modern times may have the luxury
          of ice on demand, for a majority of history, ice has remained
          unobtainable to most people. In 400 BC, persian engineers had created
          means for storing ice in the middle of the desert. By creating large
          underground spaces that we naturally cooled called yakhchal, the
          persians were able to store large amounts of ice from nearby
          mountains. These technological advances allowed for the persian
          royalty to enjoy chilled treats in the hot summer months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet by the 19th century, almost every family had a refrigerator
          powered by ice. So how is it that what once was reserved for the most
          wealthy became a common house hold commodity? Due to the enterprising
          efforts of one young man, ice shipped from the US soon was being sold
          around the world, refreshing drinks from Hong Kong to Brazil.
          Revolutionizing how food was stored around the world. The
          comodification of ice demonstrates the transition of goods from a
          luxury to a staple.

              These icehouses had windtraps to help cool the icehouses even on

              The Romans built large ice pits in the Alps. These pits would be filled with alternating layers of snow and straw. These layers would allow the air at the bottom to remain at the freezing point well into summer. The Romans were known to refrigerate cheese, wine, and oysters.

              Icehouses were designed to keep ice cool during hot summer months
              before refrigeration. While some ice houses were nothing more than
              dirt mounds, others were large, subterainian, brick-lined
              cylinders, like the one at Montecillo (shown here). Later, straw
              was used in addition to stone to provide insulation. Their large
              openings allowed ice to be packed tightly, reducing melting.
              Despite this innovation, ice houses were still a luxury reserved
              only for plantation and estate owners. Most still relied on
              smoking, drying, and salting to preserve food.

              eventually became rich and famous off of this business.

              Tudor was not without his competitors, most famously Dr. John Gorrie. Dr. Gorrie developed and patented the first mechanical refrigerator. It was initially used to chill the air of his office to help patients with yellow fever. He observed that when fall came and the temperature cooled, yellow fever wouldn’t spread. Little did he know, the disease was actually carried by mosquitoes. His hand-powered machine expanded air to cool his surroundings. He developed both an ice machine and an air conditioner. He received a patent in 1851. Tudor was not pleased at his new competition and ran a smear campaign which led to negative press causing Gorrie to run out of funding and die in 1855.
